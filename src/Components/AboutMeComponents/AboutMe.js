    Soon to graduate from the Professional Software Development course at CodeClan and with a BSc in Computer Science from previous Education, I am looking to take the first step in my Software Development career.<br/><br/>
    While my previous career path was very fruitful and rewarding, I am looking to use my skills in coding, alongside my transferrable skills, to work in an industry that has always been a personal and professional interest of mine, where I can develop to my potential and collaborate closely with my colleagues .<br/><br/>
    I take pride in my work, regardless of the task, and have a work-ethic to match my drive for development, both in my own abilities and in projects, which I believe will be well suited to a career in tech.
